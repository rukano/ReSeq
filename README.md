A tool for sequence generation and live coding in Renoise
---------------------------------------------------------

ReSeq tries to bring some live coding ideas to Renoise. By making a simplified pattern description and allowing custom formulas and mathematical expressions, it is possible to fill the current pattern track with algorithmically produced values.

DISCLAIMER
----------

ReSeq is under **HEAVY** developement. Everything can change and it's not very usable right now. Use at your own risk. I'm happy about recommendations, help, hints and suggestions you can give me. "You can't programm", "Nice tool, but not usable", "I rocked the club yesterday with your tool", anything is acceptable, I'm open for critique.
